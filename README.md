# React Typescript Boilerplate

This boilerplate using `react-app-rewired` helps to override `create-react-app` webpack config without running `eject`. Currently, it does:

- support experimental [`react-fast-refresh`](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604).
- support `tailwindcss`.
- support `styled-component`, plus `twin.macro` for integrating with `tailwind` classes.
- support `bundle-analyzer` to analyze bundle size.
